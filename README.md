The "Waste Management Using AI and ML" project leverages machine learning for automated waste classification, aiming to improve sorting processes for recyclables and non-recyclables. 
Using Streamlit as the front-end interface, this application allows users to upload images or capture real-time images through a webcam to detect and classify waste categories.
The project applies AI models like YOLOv8  for object detection and classification, distinguishing items such as plastic, glass, e-waste, and more.
For ease of user interaction, the interface provides adjustable confidence thresholds and displays detected items as recyclable or non-recyclable.
By streamlining waste categorization, this tool can potentially enhance recycling efforts and reduce environmental impact, providing a user-friendly, accessible solution for effective waste management.
